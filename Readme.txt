# eStore-platform-c++

### Description

This is a c++ program that follows the example of an online ecommerce store, where there is a server with json data about products, clients, addresses. A user can perform minimalistic tasks, such like adding a product in his cart, removing it, searching a product on the server by different attributes. It can also have a plan (basic, premium) that brigns them some benefits (like transport decuction).

### Installing

* **Run this command** git clone [https://github.com/costingh/Java.git](https://github.com/costingh/Java.git) 

### Implementation

* The implementation follows OOP concepts (abstraction, encaplsulation, inheritance, polymorphism). 
* The design pattern used is singleton.
	* Singleton design pattern is a software design principle that is used to restrict the instantiation of a class to one object. 
	* This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system (our server). 
* All the data is stored in JSON format, using a JSON library called nlohmann-json. Check it out [here](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
